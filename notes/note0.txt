What am I going to call this game....

Deathication? (Death Vacation)

On Death's Bed <-- Get it? It's the Grim Reaper's bed.  He 
sleeps on it.  He's Death.  It's his bed.. he want to sleep.

I am a brilliant buffoon <------ That right there is true

Topic: No Death State

A specific being.  Grim Reaper, and he's missing.  What happens to the world?


Bodies pile up, or do they?  No, people don't die.  People that should be dead?

What if you are the grim reaper?  Trying to get back from vacation...

You have no death state, as you are death himself.

And there is no death on this world.  And you have to bring balance to life and death.





You have different states you can enter, which offer a boon and a bane
No death, no move?


Why would people choose this... =(

I need to come up with an idea.  I don't know.


Maybe I need some dinner.  Will be in about 5 minutes.

Really, my wife made a good dinner... Death State...  Mode... a state in which you cannot
die... but makes it so you can't do other things?

Death isn't just you being dead

Death is a mythical being.
The grim reaper.

No Grim Reaper State

the Grim Reaper is no longer active
